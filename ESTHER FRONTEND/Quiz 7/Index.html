  <h2>My awesome video</h2>

  <p>Esther is always a shy person at first, but once she gets to know you, she is the sweetest person on Earth. She is in a lot of gifted and honors classes, but doesn't necessarily enjoy school. She can be a real rebel when she wants to be, but in her good moods she is very quiet and thoughtful. Nobody likes to make fun of Esther because she is just her, and people know who they are talking about when she is mentioned. People refer to her as "the smart one" or "the shy one" or "the pretty one". She is also very encouraging and loves to give advice to people and help everyone with their problems. Once you start knowing Esther, you won't want to go back. She is a real friend and in most cases, a loyal girlfriend.</p>
