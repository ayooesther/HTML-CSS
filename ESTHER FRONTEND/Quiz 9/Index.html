         <h2>Exploring more about Esther</h2>
         <p>Esther is always a shy person at first, but once she gets to know you, she is the sweetest person on Earth. She is in a lot of gifted and honors classes, but doesn't necessarily enjoy school. She can be a real rebel when she wants to be, but in her good moods she is very quiet and thoughtful. Nobody likes to make fun of Esther because she is just her, and people know who they are talking about when she is mentioned. People refer to her as "the smart one" or "the shy one" or "the pretty one". She is also very encouraging and loves to give advice to people and help everyone with their problems. Once you start knowing Esther, you won't want to go back. She is a real friend and in most cases, a loyal girlfriend.</p>


         <p>They are the human embodiement of perfection. They have such a unique character, flair and poise. She is super loving and caring. She's higly affectionate and easy to fall in love with. Once you even begin to admire her, there's no going back. She'll keep you enthralled and mesmorised by even the way she talks to you. She loves to sashay and she does it with finesse, turning every guy's head as she skips by (especially when she's in a mini skirt :p). She is a total sweetheart - pretty, smart and humourous- the complete package. They are the perfect girlfriends, though short, its cute, especially when it comes to kissing becaise her boyfriend simply picks her up and cradles her in his arms. She's practically God's finest creation and a spitting image of her parents. A total Goddess. I love Esthersâ™¥</p>
